%% Writing Scripts

%% Challenge #1
% Using analyse_data as as model, create your own script called
% plot_data that plots mean, min, max and std calculated over all patients for each day.

%% Challenge 1 - Extension
% Plotting using subplots
 
% Type help subplot in the command window or search the documentation
% Can you work out how to create two plots in the same figure?
 
% Plot the four plots you have generated with your analyse.data script, but now arrange them in a subplot so that you have two plots in the first 
% row and two in the second row
% Give all subplots x and y labels and a title.


%% Challenge #2
% Add a line to your script that will save the plot you generated 
% as a png file in the current working directory.

%% Challenge 2 - Extension
% Using the 'hold' function plot the mean, minimum and maximum inflammation
% in the same figure. See if you can use different colours to differentiate
% between the different parameters. Add a legend to your figure. Save your
% figure as a png.
 
% Look at the documentation for print and see if you can work out how to
% save your plot in a different format
 
% Can you also work out how to save it at a higher resolution?


%% Challenge #3
% Debugging scripts

% Open pie_script1.m and debug it
