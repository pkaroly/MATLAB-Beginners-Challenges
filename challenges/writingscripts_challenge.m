%% Writing Scripts

%% Challenge #1
% Plot mean, min, max and std calculated over all patients for each day in 
% a subplot. Arrange your subplot so that you have two plots in the first 
% row and two in the second row.
% Give all subplots x and y labels and a title.

%% Challenge #2
% Add a line to your script that will save the plot you generated 
% as a png file in the current working directory.

%% Extension
% Using the 'hold' function plot the mean, minimum and maximum inflammation
% in the same figure. See if you can use different colours to differentiate
% between the different parameters. Add a legend to your figure. Save your
% figure as a png.

% Look at the documentation for print and see if you can work out how to
% save your plot in a different format

% Can you also work out how to save it at a higher resolution?

%% Challenge #3
% Debugging scripts

% Debug pie_script
