%% PIE
% This code is buggy! Please debug it for me :)

Pie = pi;                   % mmmm pie
HalfAPie = Pi/2             % oh... less pie :(
ImaginaryPie = Pi*i;        % this would be a great band name
HowHungryIAm = 100          % so very hungry...
SizeOfBite = 0..03;         % I have a small mouth
PieLeftover = Pie;
I'mSoHungry = ['oh yes, so very hungry];


% no time to debug code, must find pie...mmmmmmmm pie.... 
% this is the end of the code
