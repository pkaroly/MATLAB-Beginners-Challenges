% CHALLENGE TWO


%% Challenge 2 - Extension
% MATLAB is most useful for dealing with numbers, so we haven't 
% talked much about strings (vectors of letters).

% Create a string with your celebrity name in it and call it my_name
% (HINT your celebrity name is your middle name followed by the name of the first
% street you lived on)

% Create a new variable called my_code_name, which contains only
% every second letter of my_name
% (HINT: remember how to index in steps?)


% Create your own code (for an example
% see what fliplr does to my_name)

example_code_name = fliplr(my_name);

%% Challenge 3 
% You saw how to calculate the mean inflammation for different
% dimensions
% Now create a variable that contains the maximum inflammation on each day
% and another with the maximum for each patient
 
% HINT: Using max on different dimensions is not exactly the same as mean -
% check the documentation!!


%% Challenge 3 - EXTENSION 
% Plot your result
 
%  Repeat for min and std.
